# ClimaCast

> This project showcases how to connect an ASP.Net application with a third-party API, which includes OpenWeatherAPI, NewsAPI, and ExchangeRatesAPI.

---

ClimaCast is a website that offers a comprehensive range of weather-related features such as weather forecasts, world weather, weather maps, news articles, and foreign currency exchange rates. The website was built with ASP.Net Web API for the backend and Angular for the frontend, providing an interactive and responsive user interface. Tailwind was used for the website's styling, which offers a modern and clean design.

The website offers real-time weather data and forecasts for multiple locations around the world from OpenWeatherMap API. The world weather feature offers users the ability to search and view weather conditions for any location globally, while the weather map feature provides an interactive map that allows users to view weather patterns and data.

In addition to weather-related features, ClimaCast also offers news articles that are relevant to weather and climate from NewsAPI. It also utilizes ExchangeRatesAPI to provide foreign currency exchange rates. These features provide a well-rounded experience for users who are interested in both weather and finance.
